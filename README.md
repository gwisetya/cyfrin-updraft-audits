# 🔒 Smart Contract Security Practice Portfolio
### Cyfrin Updraft Online Course – Gabriel Isa Wisetya

Welcome to my smart contract security practice portfolio!  
This repository contains hands-on exercises and personal projects completed as part of the [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft) online course, a comprehensive program focused on Solidity development and blockchain security.

## 📘 About the Course

**Cyfrin Updraft** is a free, open-source course designed to teach smart contract development and security from the ground up. It covers core Solidity topics, security vulnerabilities, secure design patterns, and common attacks seen in decentralized applications.

This portfolio demonstrates my journey through the course — practicing vulnerabilities, exploiting contracts in a controlled environment, and securing them with the right techniques.
